# Volcengine DataPro Skill

This bundled Skill is a deliberately narrow recipe for discovering and calling
the configured professional-dataset search tool. Discovery alone is never
presented as proof that a search is usable; the real search response carries
the strict success signal.

## Install

A Skill is a directory of files, so installing one is copying that directory
somewhere an agent looks. With Node 18+ and nothing cloned:

```bash
npx github:PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S install volcengine-datapro --target claude
```

`--target claude` writes to `~/.claude/skills`, `claude-project` to
`./.claude/skills`, `openai4s` to `<data_dir>/user-skills`, and `--dir <path>`
to anywhere you name; `--dry-run` prints the resolved absolute path and writes
nothing. A reinstall refuses to overwrite a copy you have edited, and
`uninstall` removes only the files it wrote. The same command under the
package's published name, which is not on npm yet, is
`npx openai4s-skills install volcengine-datapro`.

Without Node, take the directory itself — and turn it into a `.zip` if an
upload field wants one:

```bash
curl -L https://codeload.github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S/tar.gz/refs/heads/main \
  | tar -xz --strip-components=2 OpenAI4S-main/skills/volcengine-datapro
python3 -m zipfile -c volcengine-datapro.zip volcengine-datapro
```

The click-through form of that same download is the
[repository zip](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/OpenAI4S/archive/main.zip):
unzip it and copy `skills/volcengine-datapro/` out. If you already run OpenAI4S
there is nothing to install — the wheel ships every bundled Skill, and a
bundled Skill takes precedence over a same-named copy in
`<data_dir>/user-skills`. Targets, provenance, and what the installer refuses
to do: [`tools/skills-installer/`](../../tools/skills-installer/README.md).
